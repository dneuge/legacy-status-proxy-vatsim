This disclaimer is a more application-specific addition to the general points
stated in the MIT license.

By using the application and accepting this disclaimer you confirm that you
also accept all related software licenses. This includes (but may not be
limited to) the MIT and Apache 2.0 licenses. See the list of dependencies for
more information (available from "About" dialog on GUI or by running with
--version on CLI). Generic copies of all license texts are available at
runtime from the "About" dialog or by running --license <LICENSE> on CLI
(see --help or --version for more information on usage). Redistribution of
this software in binary form may be subject to the restrictions set by
combination of the software licenses of all included dependencies.

The server is intended to enable "passive" clients (e.g. status monitors) to
access more current data formats than they originally support. A "passive"
client only consumes status information but does not perform any interaction
with the live VATSIM network.

The server shall not be used to provide information to unsupported "active"
clients (pilot or ATC clients) which directly interact with the actual VATSIM
network (not just consuming status information). Providing manipulated
information to such clients may result in unintended behaviour or enable
otherwise unapproved or outdated software to access VATSIM. This may be a
violation of the Code of Conduct (e.g. item A7 as of March 2021).

All data processed and served by the proxy server is subject to policies and
restrictions set by VATSIM. By default requests are only served to local
applications (identified by IP addresses 127.0.0.1 or ::1). Depending on your
local regulation served data may be considered privacy-relevant and thus
should be handled carefully in accordance to local regulations and legal
requirements as well as all other applicable policies. It is recommended to
host this server strictly private and not open access to the general public.

By using the server you agree with all terms of the MIT license, including
(but not limited to) the general disclaimer:

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
